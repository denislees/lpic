201.2 Compiling a kernel
========================

/usr/src/linux
GRUB configuration files
Kernel 2.6.x make targets
Kernel 3.x make targets

mkinitrd

	creates an initial image used by the kernel for preloading the block device modules (such as IDE, SCSI or RAID) which are needed to access the root filesystem.

	automatically loads filesystem modules (such as ext3 and jbd). IDE modules, all scsi_hostadapter entries in /etc/modprobe.conf and raid modules if the system's root partition is on raid, which makes it simple to build and use kernels using modules device drivers

	any module options specified in /etc/modporbe.conf are passed to the modules as they are loaded by the initial ramdisk

the root filesystrem used by the kernel is specified in the boot configuration file. as aways. the traditional root/dev/hda1 sytle device specification is allowed. if a label is used. as in root=LABEL=rootPart the initrd will search all available devices for an ext2 and ext3 filesystem with the appropriate label and mound that divce as the root filesystem.


mkinitramfs

	the mkinitramfs script generates an initramfs image. the initramfs is a compressed cpio archive. the archive can be used on a different box of the same arch with the corresponding linux kernel. mkinitramfs is meant for advanced usage. on your local box update-initramfs calls mkinitramfs with the relevant parameters. update-initramfs keeps sha1sum of generated initramfs. it takes care to generate backup and eventually runs the bootloader

	at boot time, the kernel unpack that archive into RAM disk, mounts and uses it as initial root file system. all finding of the root device hapens in this early userspace


make

	the purpose of the make utility is to determine automaticlly which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands to recompile them. 
	to propare to use make, you mus wirte a file called the makefile that describes the relationships among file sin your program, and the states the commands for updating each file. in a program, typically the executable file is updated from object files, which are in turn made by compiling source files.
	make execute commands in the makefile to update one or more target names, where name is typically a program. if no -f option is present make will look for the makefiles: GNUmakefile, makefile, and Makefile, in that order.
	normally you should call your makefile etther makefile or Makefile. (we recommand Makefile because it appears prominently near the begingin of a directory listing, right near other important files such as README.)'


make targets
	config
		update the current kernel configuration by using a line-orientend program.

	xconfig
		updates the current kernel configuration by using a QT-based graphical program

	menuconfig
		updates  the current kernel configuration using a text basesd menu progarm

	oldconfig
		updated the current kernel by using the current .config file and propting for any new options that have been added to the kernel.
	
	mrproper
		removes all of the generated files by the kernel build system, including the configuration and some various backup files.

	zImage

	bzImage
		creates a compressed kernel image and places it in the arch/i386/boot/bzImage file. this is the default target for the i386 kernel build

	modules
		builds all of the loadable kernel modules for this configuration
	modules_install
		install all of the modules into the specified location. if no location is specified with the INSTALL_MODULE_PATH environment variable, they are installed in the default root directory of the machine.

201.3 Patching a kernel
=======================

Customize the current kernel configuration
Build a new kernel and appropriate kernel modules
Install a new kernel and anyu modules.
Ensure that the boot manager can locate the new kernel and associated files.

Module configuration files

patch

	apply a diff file to an original

	patch takes a patch file patchfile containing a difference listing produced by the diff program and applies those differences to one or more original files, producing patched versions. normally the patched versions are put in place of the originals. backups can be make; see the -b or --backup option. the name of the files to be patched are usually taken from the patch file, but if there's just one file to be patched it can be specified on the command line as originalfile.

	first, patch takes an ordered list of candidate file names as follows:
		- if the header is that of a context diff, patch takes the old and new files names in the header. a name is ignored if it does not have enought slashes to satisfy the -p[num] or --strip=[num] option. the name /dev/null is also ignored.
		- if there is an index: line in the leading garbage and if either the old and new names are both absent or if patch is conforming to posix, patch take s the name in the index: line.
	/u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c
		setting -p0 gives the entire file name unmodified, -p1 gives
	u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c
		setting to -p4 gives
	blurfl/blurfl.c

201.5 Manage/Query kernel and kernel modules at runtime
=======================================================

user command-line utilities to get information about the currently running kernel and kernel modules.
manually load and unload kernel modules
determine when modules can be unloaded
determine what parameters a module accepts
configure the system to load modules by names other than their file name.

/lib/modules/kernle-version/modules.dep
	the moduels.dep as generated by module-init-tools depmod. lists the dependencies for every module int he directories under /dliv/modules/version where modules.dep is
	black lines, and lines starting with a '#' (ignoraing spaces) are ignored. other lines are of the form "filename: [filename]*".
	for example. if /lib/modules/2.6.29/kernel/a.ko depended on b.ko and c.ko in the same directory, and c.ko depended on b.ko as well, the file mitght look like 
		/lib/modules/2.6.29/kernel/a.ko: /lib/modules/2.6.29/kernel/c.ko /lib/modules/2.6.29/kernel/b.ko
		/lib/modules/2.6.29/kernel/b.ko: 
		/lib/modules/2.6.29/kernel/c.ko: /lib/modules/2.6.29/kernel/b.ko 
	this file is used by modprobe to know the order in which to load modules (they are loaded right to left, and removed left to right.)


module configuration files in /etc


/proc/sys/kernel/
	bootloader_type:
	x86 bootloader identification
	this gives the bootloader type number as indicated by the bootloader shifted left by 4, and OR'd with the low four bits of the bootloader version. the reason for this encoding is that this used to match the type_of_loader field in the kernel header; the encoding is kept for backwards compatibility. that is, the full bootloader type number is 0x15 and the full version number is 0x234.

	domainname & hostname:
	these files can be used to set NIS/YP domainname and the hostname of your box in exactly the same way as the commands domainname and hostname, i.e.:
	# echo 'darkstar' > /proc/sys/kernel/hostname
	# echo 'mydomain' > /proc/sys/kernel/domainname

	osrelease, ostype & version:
	# cat osrelease
	2.1.88
	# cat ostype
	Linux
	# cat version
	#5 Wed Feb 25 21:44 MET 1998

	the files osrelease and ostype should be clear enough. version needs a little more clarification however. the '#5' means that this is the fifth kernel built from this source base and the date behind it indicates the time the kernel was built. the only way to tune these values is to rebuild the kernel.

	panic:
	the value in this file represents the number of seconds the kernel waits before rebooting on a panic. when you use the software watchdog, the recommended setting is 60.

	panic_on_oops:
	controls the kernels behaviour when an oops or bug is encountered.
	0: try to continue operation
	1: panic imediately. if the 'panic' sysctl is also non-zero then the machine will be rebooted.

	pid_max:
	PID allocation wrap value. when the kernel's next PID value reaches this value, it wraps back to the minimum PID value. PIDs value pid_max or larger are not allocated.

	shmall:
	this parameter set the total amount of shared memory pages that can be used system wide. hence, SHMALL should always be at least ceil (shmmax/PAGE_SIZE).
	
	shmmax:
	this value can be used to query and set the run time limit on the maximum shared memory segment size that can be created. Shared memory segments up to 1Gb are now supported in the kernel. this value defaults to SHMMAX.

depmod
	program to generate modules.dep and map files

	depmod creates a list of modules dependencies by reading earch module under /lib/modules/version and determining what symbols it exports and what symbols it needs. by default, this list is written to modules.dep, and a binary hashed version named modules. dep.bin, in the same directory. if filenames are given on the command line, only those modules are examined (which is rerely useful unless all modules are listed). depmod also creates a list of symbols provided by modules in the file named modules.symbols and its binary hashed version, modules.symbos.bin



insmod
	simple program to insert a module into the linux kernel

	insmod is a trivial program to insert a module into the kernel: if the filename is a hypen, the module is taken from standard input. most users will want to use modprobe instead, which is more cleaver and can handle module dependencies.

	only the most general of error messages are reported: as the work of trying to link the module is now done inside the kernel, the dmesg usually gives more information about errors.


lsmod
	program to show the status of modules in the linux kernel
	lsmod is a trivial program which nicely formats the contents of the /proc/modules, showing what kernel modules are currently loaded.


rmmod
	simple program to remove a module from the linux kernel
	rmmod is a trivial program to remove a module (when module unloading support is provided) from the kernel. mos users will want to use modprobe with the -r option instead.


modinfo
	program to show information about a linux kernel module
	modinfo extracts information from the linux kernel modules given on the command line. if the module name is not a filename, then the /lib/modules/version directory is searched, as is also done by modprobe when loading kernel modules.
	

modprobe
	program to add and remove modules from the linux kernel

	modprobe intelligently adds or removes a module from the linux kernel: note that for convenience, there is no difference between _ and - in modules names (automatic underscore conversion is performed). modprobe looks in the module directory /lib/modules/'uname -r' for all the modules and other files, except for the optional /etc/modprobe.conf configuration file and /etc/modprobe.d directory. modprobe will also use module options specified on the kernel command line in the form of <module>.<option>


uname
	print system information
	print certain system information. with no option, same as -s.



202.1 Customising system startup and boot process
=================================================

linux standard base specification (lsb)

	the linux standard base is a joint project by serveral linux distributions under the organizational structure of the linux foundation to stadardize the software system structure, including the filesystem hieararchy used in the GNU/Linux operating sstem. the LSB is based on the POSIX specification, the single nix specification, and several other open standards, but extends them in certain areas.

	the goal of the LSB is to develop and promote a set of open stardards that will increase compatibility among linux distributions and enable software applications to run on any compliant system event in binary form. in addition, the lsb will help coordinate efforts to recruit software vendors to port and write products for linux operating systems.


/etc/inittab

	format of the inittab file used by the sysv-compatible init process
	the init file describe which processes are started at bootup and during normal operation (e.g. /etc/init.d/boot, /etc/init.d/rc, gettys) init distinguishes multiple runleves, earch which can have its own set of processes that are started. valid runlevels are 0-6 plus A, B, and C for ondemand entries. and entry in the inittab ifle has following format:
		id:runlevels:action:process


/etc/init.d

/etc/rc.d

chkconfig(redhat)
	updates and queries runlevel information for system servics

	# chkconfig --list --type <type> <name>
	# chkconfig --add <name>
	# chkconfig --del <name>
	# chkconfig --override <name> 
	# chkconfig --level <levels> --type <type> <name>
	# chkconfig --level <levels> --type <type> <name>

	chkconfig provides a simples command-line tool for maintaining the /etc/rc[0-6].d directory hierarchy by relieving system administrators of the task of directly manipulating the numerous symbolic link in those directories

	this implementation of chkconfig was inspired by the chkconfig command present in the IRIX operating system. rather than maintaining configuration information outside of the /etc/rc[0-6].d hierarchy, however, this version directly manages the symlinks in /etc/rc[0-6].d this leaves all of the configuration information regarding that services init starts in a single location.

	chkconfig has five distinct functions: adding new services for management, removing services from management, listing the current setartup information for services, changing the startup information for services, and checking the startup state of a particular service.
	when chconfig is run with only a service name, it checkgs to see if the service is configured to be started in the current runlevel. if it is, chkconfig returns true; otherwise it returns false. the --level option may be used to have chkconfig query an alternative runlevel rather than the current one.

	when chkconfig is run with the --list argument, or no argument at all, a listing isdisplayed of all services and their current configuration.
	if one of on, off, reset, or resetpriorities is specified after the service name, chconfig changes the startup information for the specified service. the on and off flags cause the service to be started  or stopped, respectively, in the runlevels being changed. to the reset flag resets the on/off state for all runlevels for the service to whatever is specified in the init script in question, while the resetpriorities flag resets the start/stop priorities for the service to whatever is specified in the init script.

	by default the on and off option affects only runlevels 2, 3, 4 and 5. while reset and resetpriorities affects all of the runlevels. the --level option may be used to specify which runlevels are affected.

	note that for every service, each runlevel has either a start script or a stop script. when switching runvelevels, init will not restart an already started service, and will not re-stop a service that is not running.

	chkconfig also can manage xinetd scripts via the means of xinetd.d configuration files. cnote that only the on, off, and --list commands are supported for xinitd.d services.

	chkconfig supports a --type argument to limit actions to only a specific type of services, in the case where services of either type may share a name. possible values for type are sysv and xinitd.	


update-rc.d
	install and remove systev style init script links

	update-rc.d updates the system v style init script links /etc/rc(runlevel).d/(NN)name whose target is the script /etc/init.d/name. these links are run by init when it changes runlevels; they are generally used to start and stop system services such as daemons. runlevel is one of the runveles susported by init, namely, 0123456789S, and (NN) is the two-digit sequence number that determines where in the sequence init will run the scripts.

	update-rc.d firewall start 99 1 2 3 .
	update-rc.d -f firewall remove


202.2 system recovery
=====================

inittab

GRUB

grub shell


init
	process control initialization
	init is the parent of all process. its primary role is to create process from a script stored in the file /etc/inittab. this file usually has entries which cause init to spawn gettys on each line that users can log in. it also controls autonomous processes required by any particular system.

	a runlevel is a software configuration of the ssytem which allows only a selected group of processes to exist. the processes spawned by init for each of theses runlevels are defined in the ;/etc/inittab file. init can be in one of eight runlevels: 0-6 and S. the run level is changet by having a privileged user run telinit, which sends appropriate signal to init, telling it which runlevel to change to.


mount
	mount a filesystem

	all files accessible in a unix system are arrenget in one big tree, the file hieararchy, rooted at /. these files can be spread out over several devices. the mount command serves to attach the filesystem found on some device to the big file tree. conversely, the umount command will detach it again.

	the standard form of the mount command is
		mount -t type device dir


fsck
	check and repair a linux file system

	fsck is used to check and optionally repair one or more linux file systems. filesys can be a device name (e.g. /dev/hdc1, /dev/sdb2), a mount pount


telinit
	change linux runlevel.


203.1 Operating the linux filesystem
====================================

the concept of the fstab configuration
tools and utilities for handling swap partitions anf iles
use of UUIDs


/etc/fstab
	static information about the filesystems

	the file fstab contains descriptive information about the various file systems. fstab is only read by programs, and not written; it is the duty of the system administrator to properly create and maintain this file. Each filesystem is described on a separete line; fields on each line are separeted by tabs or spaces. lines starting with '#' are comments, blank lines are ignored. the order of reords in fstab is important because fsck, mount, and umount sequentially iterate through fstab doing their thing.

	first field
		this field describes the block special device or remote filesystem to be mounted.
		for ordinary mounts it will hold a link to a block special device node (as created by mknod for the device to be mounted, line '/dev/cdrom' or '/dev/sdb6'. for NFS mounts one will have <host>:<dir>.
	second field (mount point for the filesystem)
	third field (type of the filesystem)
	fourth field (mount options associated with the filesystem)
	fifth field
		this field is used for these filesystem by the dump command to determine which filesystems need to be dumped. if the fifth field is not present, a value of zero is returned and dump will assume that the filesystem does not neet to be dumped.
	sixth field
		this filed is used by the fsck program to determine the order which filesystem checks are done at reboot time. the root filesystem should be specified with a fs_passno of 1, and other filesystems should have a fs_passno of 2. filesystems within a drive will be checked sequentially, but filesystems on a different drives will be checked at the same time to utilize parallelism available in the hardware. if the sixth field is not present or zero, a value of zero is returned and fsck will assume that the filesystem does not need to be checked.


/etc/mtab

	the mtab (contraction of mounted filesystems table) file is a system information file, commonly found on unix-like systems. this file list all currently mounted filesystems along with their initialization options. mtab has a lot in common with fstab, the main distiction being that the latter list all available filesystems whereas the former lists only currently mounted ones. therefore mtab is usually in a format similar to that of fstab. most of the time is possible to directly use lines from mtab in fstab.


/proc/mounts


mount and umount
	mount a filesystem
	standard form of the mount command is:
		mount -t <type> <device> <dir>
	this tells the kernel to attach the filesystem found on device (which is of type <type>) at the directory <dir>. the previous contents (if any) and owner and mode of <dir> become invisible, and as long as this filesystem remains mounted, the pathname <dir> refers to the root of the filesystem on <device>


sync
	flush file system buffers
	force changed blocks to disk, update the super block.


swapon
	enable/disable devices and files for paging and swapping
	swapon is used to specify devices on which paging and swapping are to take place.

	the device or file used is given by the specialfile parameter. it may be of the form -L label or -U uuid to indicate a device by label or uuid.

	calls to swapon normally occur in the system boot scripts making all swap devices available, so that the paging and swapping activity is interleaved across several devices and files.


	swapoff disables swapping on the specified device and files. when the -a flag is given, swapping is disabled on all known swap devices and files (as found in /proc/swaps or /etc/fstab).

	
swapoff

203.2 maintaining a linux filesystem
====================================

tools and utilities to manipulate ext2, ext3 and ext4
tools and utilities to manipulate reiserfs V3
tools and utilities to manipulate xfs


fsck (fsck.*)

	check and repair a Linux filesystem

	fsck is used to check and optionally repair one or more linux filesystems. filesys can be a device name (e.g. /dev/hdc1, /dev/sdb2), a mount point (e.g., /e, /usr, /home), or an ext2 label or UUID specifier (e.g. UUID=8855... etc or LABEL=root). normally, the fsck program will try to handle filesystems on different physical disk drives in parallel to reduce the total amount of time needed to check all of them.

	if no filesystems are specified on the command line, and the -A option is not specified, fsck will default to checking filesystems in /etc/fstab serially. this is equivalent to be the -As options.


badblocks
	search a device for bad blocks

	badblocks is used to search a bad block on a device (usually a disk partition). device is the special file corresponding to the device (e.g. /etc/hdc1) last-block is the last block to be checked; if it is not specified, the last block on the device is used as a default. first-block is an optinal parameter specifying the starting block number for the test, which allows the testing to start in the middle of the disk. if it is not specified the first block on the disk is used as a default.

	if the output badblocks is going to be fed to the e2fsch or mke2fs programs, it is important that the block size is promperly specified, sinse the block numbers whiich are generated are very dependent on the block size in size by the filesystem. for this reason, it is strongly recommended that users not run badblock directlu, but rather use the -c option of the e2fsck and mke2fs programs.


mkfs (mkfs.*)
	build a linux file system
	mkfs is used to build a linux file system on a device, usually a hard disk partition. filesys is either the device name (e.g., /dev/hda1, /dev/sdb2), or a regular file that shall contain the file system. blocks is the number of blocks to be used for the file system.

	the exit code returned by mkfs is 0 on sucess and 1 on failure.

	in actuality, mkfs is simply a front-end for the various file system builds (mkfs.fstype) available under linux. the file system-specific build is searched for in a number of directories like perhaps.


dumpe2fs, xfsdump, xfsrestore
	dump ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem information

	dumpe2fs prints the superblock and block groups information for the filesystem present on device.
	dumpe2fs is similar to beckley dumpfs program for the bsd fast file system.


debugfs, debugreiserfs
	file system debugger

	the debugfs program is an interactive file system debugger. it can be used to examine and change the state of an ext2, ext3, or ext4 file system.
	device is the special file corresponding to the device containing the file system (e.g. /dev/hdxx)


tune2fs, reiserfstune
	ajust tunable filesystem parameters on ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystems
	tune2fs allows the system administrator to ajust various tunable filesystem parameters on linux ext2, ext3 and ext4 filesystems. the current values of theses options can be displayed  by using the -l option to tune2fs porgram or by using the dumpe2fs program.


mkswap
	set up a linux swap area
	mkswap set up a linux swap area on a device or in a file

	 the device argument will usually be a disk partition (something like /dev/sdb7) but can also be file a file. the linux kernel does not look at partition ids, but many installation scripts will assume that partitions of hex type 82 (linux_swap) are meant to be swap partitions.


xfs_info, xfs_check and xfs_repair


203.3 Creating and configuring filesystem options
=================================================

autofs configuration files
UDF and ISO9660 tools and utilities
awareness of CD-ROM filesystems (UDF, ISO9660, HFS)
awareness of CD-ROM filesystem extensions (Joliet, Rock Ridge, El Torito)
basic feature knowlodge of encrypted filesystems

/etc/auto.master
/etc/auto.[dir]
mkisofs


dd
	convert and copy a file
	copy a file converting and formatting according to the operands.


mke2fs
	create and ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem
	mke2fs is used to create an ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystem usually in a disk partition. device is the special file corresponding to the device (e.g./dev/ddXX). blocks-count is the number of blocks on the device. if omitted, mke2fs automagically figures the file system size. if called as mkfs.ext3 a journal is created as if the -j option was specified.

	the defaults of the parameters for the newly created filesystem, if not overridden by the option listed below, are controlled by the overridden by the option listed below, are controlled by the /etc/mkefs.conf configuration file.


203.4 udev device management
============================

udev rules
kernel interface


(udev)
	udev is a replacement ofor the device filesystem (devfs) starting with the linux 2.6 kernel series. it allows you to identify devices based on their properties, like vendor ID and device ID, dynamically. udev runs in userspace (as opposed to devfs which was executed in kernel space)

	udev allows for urles that specify what name is given to a device, regardless of which port is plugged into. for example, a rule to always mount a hard drive with manufacturer "iRiver"  and drive code "ABC" as /dev/iriver is possible. this consistent naming of devices guarantees that scripts dependent on a specific device's existence will not be broken
	
	the udev system is composed of some kernel services and the udevd daemon. the kernel informs the udevd daemon when certain events happen. the udevd daemon is configured to respond to events with corresponding actions. the event information comes from the kernel - the action happen in userspace. the responses to the events are configurable in "rules".

	the udevd daemon, like other damemons, starts on boot because of an init script: /etc/rcS.d/udev. its config files is in /etc/udev/udev.conf. the rules files (which amount to more configuration for udevd) are taken from /run/udev/rules.d, /etc/udev/rules.d or /lib/udev/rules.d (debian puts most of the rules in /lib/udev/urles.d). if a file with the same name is present in more than one of these directories the latter(s) files will be ignored. files in there are parsed in alpha order, as long as the name ends with ".rules". when the config file or rules files are changed, then the udevd daemon should be restarted (or, as mentioned further down this page, you can use the udevadm program)

	many of the files in /etc/udev/rules.d are links to files elsewhere. i'm guessing that's so that when the rules files are edited, the editor backups aren't left lying around where they might be used in the next restart of the udevd daemon. also since the links can have different names from the original files, then they can be ordered without having to worry about what names they have (as with the init scripts).

	udev was created to respond to hotplug type of events. much documentation refers to creating devices in response to new devices that have appeared. but, udev is more general; it can run arbitrary userspace commands in response to a new device appearing -or to whatever events it receives from the kernel.

	the times when udevd is active are:
	1. at startup, it parses all the config files and rule files and builds a rules database in memory
	2. when an event happens, it checks its rule database and performs the appropriate actions.


udevmonitor
	print the kernel and udev event sequence to the console
	udevmonitor listens to the kernel uevents and events send out by a udev rule and prints the devpath of the event to the console. it can be used analyze to the event timing by comparing the timestamps of the kernel uevent with the udev event.


/etc/udev
	linux dynamic device management
	udev supplies the system software with device events, manages permissions of the device nodes and may create additional symlinks in the /dev directory, or renames network interfaces. the kernel usually just assings unpredictable device names based on the order of discobery. meaningful syslinks or network device names provice a way to realiably identify devices based on their properties or current configuration.

	the udev daemon udevd receives device uevents directly from the kernel whenever a device is addes or removed from the system, or it changes its state. when udev receives a device event, it maches its configured set of rules agains various device attributes to indentify the device. rules that match, may provice additional device information to be stored in the udev database, or information to be used to create meaningful symlink names.

	all device information udev process, is stored in the udev database and sent out to possible event subscribers. access to all stored data and tohe event sources are provided by the library libudev.
	
	udev configuration files are placed in /etc/udev and /lib/udev. all empty lines, or lines beginning with '#' will be ignored.

	udev expects its main configuration file at /etc/udev/udev.conf it consists of a set of variables allowing the user to override default udev values. 


204.1 configuring RAID
======================

software raid configuration files and utilities


mdadm.conf
	configuration for management of software raid with mdadm
	mdadm is a tool for creating, managin, and monitoring raid devices using the md driver in linux
	some common tasks, such as assembling all arrays, can be simplified by describing the deivces and arrays in this configuration file.


mdadm
	manage md (multiple devices) devices aka linux software raid

	raid devices are virtual devices created from two or more real block devices. this allows multiple devices (dipically disk drives or partitions thereof) to be combined into a single device to hold (for example) a single filesystem. some raid levels include redundancy and so can survive some degree of device failure.


/proc/mdstat

	
fdisk
	partition table manipulator for linux

	hard disks can be divided into one or more logical disks called partitions. this division is described in the partition table found in sector 0 of the disk.


204.2 ajusting storage device access
====================================

tools and utilities to configure dma for ide devices including ATAPI and SATA
tools and utilities to manipulate or analyse system resources (e.g. interrupts)
awareness of sdparm command and its uses


hdparm
	get/set SATA/IDE device parameters

	hdparm provides a command line interface to various kernel interfaces supported by the linux SATA/PATA/SAS 'libata' subsystem and the older IDE driver subsystem. many newer (2008 and later) USB drive enclosures now also support "SAT" (SCSI-ATA command translation) and therefore may also work with hdparm. e.g. recent WD "passport" models and recent NexStar-3 enclosures. Some options may work correctly only with the lastest kernels.

	when no options are given, -acdgkmur ir assumed. for get/set options, a query without the optional parameter (e.g. -d) will query (get) the device state, and with a parameter (.e.g, -d0) will set the device state.


sdparm
	access SCSI mode pages; read VPD pages; send simple SCSI commands.
	this utility fetches and potentially change SCSI device mode pages. Inquiry data including Vital Product Data (VPD) pages can also be displayed. commands associated with starting  and stopping the medium; loading and unloading the medium; and other housekeeping function may also be issued by this utility.
	of the three invocations shoun in the synopsis, the fisrt is the most general. the second variant that uses --enumarate is for dumping information held in sdparm's internal tables. the variant is for windows only and lists the variable device names; see the options entry for --wscan.


tune2fs
	ajust tunable filesystem parameters on ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystems.

	tune2fs allows the system administrator to ajust various tunable filesystem parameters on Linux ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystems. the current values of these options can be displayed by using the -L option to tune2fs program, or by using the dumpe2fs program.

	the dievce specifier can either be a filename (i.e., /dev/sda1), or a LABLE or UIDD specififier: "LABEL=volume-name" or "UUID=uidd". 

	-c <max-mount-counts> 
	ajust the number of mounts after which the file system will be checked by e2fsck. if max-mount-counts is 0 or -1, the number of times the filesystem is mounted will be disregarded by e2fsck and the kernel.
	
	staggering the mount-counts at which filesystems are forcibly checked will avoid all filesystems being checked at one time when using jornaled filesystems.

	you should strogly consider the conseguences of disabling mount-count-dependant checking entirely. bad disk drives, cables, memory, and kernel bugs could all corrupt the filesystem without making the filesystem dirty or in error. if you are using journaling on your filesystem, your filesystem will never be marked dirty, so it will not normally be checked. a filesystem error detedted by the kernel will still force an fsck on the next reboot, bot it may already be too late to prvent data loos at that point.

	-C <mount-count>
	set the number of times the filesystem has been mounted. if set to a greater value than the max-mount-counts parameter se by the -c option, <e2fsck> will check filesystem at the next reboot.

	-f
	force the tune2fs operation to complete even in the face of errors. this option is useful when removing the <has_journal> filesystem feature from a filesystem which has an external journal (or is corrupted such that it appears to have an external journal), but that external journal is not available.

	-i <interval-between-checks[d|m|w]
	ajust the maximal time between two filesystems checks. no suffix or d will interpret the number <interval-between-checks> as days, m as months, and w as weeks. a value of zero will disable the time-dependent checking.

	it is strongly recommended that either -c <mount-count-dependent> or -i <time-dependent> checking to be enabled to force periodic full <e2fsck> checking of the filesystem. failure to do so may lead to filesystem corruption (due to bad disks, cables, memory or kernel bugs) going unnoticed, ultimately resulting in data loss or corruption.

	-j
	add an ext3 journal to the filesystem. if the -J option is not specified, the default journal parameters will be used to create and appropriately sized journal (given the size of the filesystem) storared within the filesystem. note that your must be using a kernel which has ext3 support in order to actually make use of the journal.

	if this option is used to create a journal on a mounted filesystem, an immutable, file .journal, will be created in the top-level directory of the filesystem, as it is the only safe way to create the journal inode while the filesystem is mounted. while the ext3 journal is invisible, it is not save to deleteit, or modify it while the filesystem is mounted; for this reason the file isimmutable. while checking unmounted filesystems, e2fsck will automatically move .journal files to the invisible, reserved journal inode. for all filesystems except for the root filesystem, this should happen automatically and naturally during the next reboot cycle. since the root filesystem is mounted read-only, e2fsck must be run from a rescue floppy in order to effect this transition.

	-J <journal-options.
	override the default ext3 journal parameters. journal options are comma separeted, and maytake an argument using the equals sign. the following jornal options are supported:

	size=<journal-size>
	device=<external-journal>

	-l
	list the contents of the filesystem superblock, including the current values of the parameters that can be set via this program.

	-L <volume-label>
	set the volume label of the filesystem. ext2 filesystem labels can be at most 16 characters long; if <volume-label> is longer than 16 characters, tune2fs will truncate it and print a warning. the volume label can be used by mount, fsck, and /etc/fstab by specifying LABEL=<volume-label> instead of a block special device name like /dev/hda5

	-u <user>
	set the user who can use the reserved filesystem blocks. user can be a numerical uid or a username. if a user name is given, it is converted to a numerical uid before it is stored in the superblock.

	-U <UUID>
	set the universally unique identifier (UUID) of the filesystem to UUID. the format of the UUID is a series of hex digits separeted by hypens.  the <UUID> parameter may also be one of the following: clear, random, time.

	
sysctl
	configure kernel parameters at runtime

	sysctl is used to modify kernle parameters at runt avaithose listed under /proc/sys/. procfs is required for sysctl support in linux. you can use sysctl to both read and write sysctl data.

	<variable>
	the name of a key to read from. an example is kernel.ostype. the '/' separator is also accepted in place of a '.'.

	<variable>=<value>
	to set a key, use the form <variable>=<value> when <variable> is the key and <value> is the value to set it to. if the value contains quotes or characters which are parsed by the shell, you may need to enclose the value in double quotes. this requires the -w parameter to use.

	-a
	display all values currently available.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/

	(redhat)
	two lesser used types of interface configuration files found in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts are <alias> and <clone> files, which include an additional component in the name of the file beyond the interface name.

	alias interface configuration files take names in the format of ifcfg-<ifname>:alias-value>, and they allow an alias to point to an interface. for example, if ifcft-eth0:o file could be configured to specify DEVICE=eth0:0 and a static ip address of 10.0.0.2, serving as an alias of an ethernet interface already configured to receive its IP information via DHCP in ifcfg-eth0. at that point, the eth0 device is bound dto a dynamic iP address, but it can always be referred to on that system via the fixed 10.0.0.2 IP address.

	clone interface configuration file has a name similar to ifcfg-<if-name>-<clone-name>. while an alias file is another way to refer to an existing interface configuration file, a clone file is used to specify additional options when specifying an interface. for example, if you have a standard DHCP Ethernet interface called eth0, it may look similar to this:
	DEVICE=eth0
	ONBOOT=yes
	BOOTPROTO=dhcp

	since userctl is not set to yes, users cannot bring this interface up and down. to give users this ability, create a clone called user from ifcfg-eth0 which allows user to bring up and down the eth0 interface. the resulting name of the clone would be ifcfg-eth0-user and would only need one line:
	USERCTL=yes

	when a user moves to bring up the eth0 interface with the ifup eth0-user command, the configuration options from ifcfg-eth0 and ifcfg-eth0-user are used together. while this is a very basic example, this method can be used with a variety of options and interfaces.

	the easiest way to create alias and clone interface configuration files is to use a gui-based network configuration (redhat-config-network) tool.

206.2 backup operations
=======================

knowledge about directories that have to be include in backups
awareness of network backup solutions such as amanda, bacula and backupPC
knowledge of the benefits and drawbacks of tapes, CDR, disk or other backup media
perform partial and manual backs.
verify the integrity of backup files.
partially or fully restore backups.

(Amanda)
	Amanda, the Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver, is a backup solution that allows the IT administrator to set up a single master backup served to backup multiple hosts over network to tape drives/chargers or disks or optical media. Amanda usees native utilities and formats (e.g., dump and/or GNU tar) and can back up a large number of servers and workstatings running multiple versions of linux or unix. amanda uses a native windows client back up microsoft windows desktops and server.


(Bacula)
	bacula is a set of open source, computer programs that permit you (or the system administrator) to manage backup, recovery, and verification of computer data across a network of computers of different kinds. Bacula is reatively easy to use and efficient, while offering many advanced storage management features that make it easy to find and recover lost or damaged files. in technical terms. it is an open source, network based backup program.
	according to source forge statistics (rank and downloads). bacula is by far the most popular open source program backup program.


(BackupPC)
	BackupPc is a high-performance, enterprise-grade system for backing up linux, win and macosX Pcs and laptops to a server's disk. backupPC is highly configurable and easy to install and maintain.

/bin/sh
cpio
	copy files to and from archives.
	support: binary, old ASCII, new ASCII, crc, HPUX binary, HPUX old ASCII, old tar, and POSIX.1 tar.
	the tar format is provided for compatibility with the tar program. by default, cpio creates binary format archives, for compatibility with older cpio programs. when extrating from archives, cpio automatically recognizes which kind of archives it is reading and can read archive created on machines with a differente byte-order.

dd
tar
/dev/st*
/dev/nst*
mt
	control magnetic tape drive operation
	the default tape device to operate on is taken from the file /usr/include/sys/mtio.h when mt is compiled. it can be overridden by giveing a device file name in the environment variable TAPE or by a command line option, which also overrides the envrironment variable.

rsync
	a fast, versitile, remote (and local) file-copying tool
	rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool. it can copy locally, to/from another host over any remote shell, or to/from a remote rsync daemon. it offersa large number of options that control every aspect of its behavior and permit very flexible specification of the set of files to be copied. it is famous for its delta-transfer algorithm, which reduces the amount of data sent over the network by sending only the differences between and mirroring and as an improved copy command for everydate use.

	rsync finds files that need to be transferred using a "quick check" algorithm (by default) that looks for files that have changed in size or in last-modified time. any changes in the other preserved attributes (as requeted by options) are made on the destination file directly when the quick check indicates that the file's data does not need to be updated.

/usr/sbin/rndc
	name server control utility

	rndc controls the operation of a name server. it supersedes the ndc utility that was provided in old bind releases. if rndc is invoked with no commmand line options or arguments, it prints a short summary of the supported commands and the available options and their arguments.

	rndc communicates with the name server over a TCP connection, sending commands authenticated with digital signatures. in the current versions of rndc and named, the only supported authentication algorithm is HMAC-MD5, which uses a shared secret on each end of the connection. this provides TSIG-style authentication for the command request and the name server's response. all commands sent over the channel must be signed by a key_id know to the server.

	rndc reads a configuration file to determine how to contatct the name server is decide that algorigthm and key it should use.

dig

	DNS lookup utility

	dig (domain information grouper) is a flexible tool for interrogating DNS name servers. it performs dns lookups and displays the answers that are returned from the name server(s) that were queried. most DNS administrators use dig to troubleshoot DNS problems because of its flexibility, ease of use and clarity of output. other lookup tools tend to have less functionality that dig.
	unless it is told to query a specific name server, dig will try each of the servers listed in /etc/resolv.conf

nslookup
	query interntet name servers interactively
	
	nslookup is a program to query internet domain name servers. nslookup has two modes: interactive and non-interactive. interactive mode allows the user to query name servers for information about various hosts and domains or to print a list of hosts in a domain. non-interactive mode is used to print just the name and requestes information for a host or domain

host
	dns lookup utility

	host is a simple utility for performing dns lookups. it is normally used to convert names to ip addresses and vice versa. when no arguments or options are given, host prints a short summary of its command line arguments and options.

	name is the domain name that is to be looked up. it can use be a dotted-decimal ipv4 addres or a colon-delimited ipv6 address, in which case host will by default perform a reverse lookup for that address server is an optional argument which is eighter the name or ip address of the name server that host should query instead of the server or servers listed in /etc/resolv.conf

dnssec

	domain name system security extensions

	protect agains DNS cache poisoning. all ansewers from DNSSEC protected zones are digitally signed. by checking the digital signature, a DNS resolver is able to check if the information is identical (i.e., unmodified and complete) to the information published by the zone owner and served on a authoritative DNS server. While protecting ip address is the immediate conrsert for many users, DNSSEC can protect any data publicshed in the DNS , including text records (TXT), mail exchange records (MX), and can be used to bootstrap other security systems that publichs references to cryptographic certificates stored in the DNS such as Certificate Records, SSH firngerprints, IPSec public keys, and TLS.

	DNSSEC does not provite confidentialy of data; in particular, all DNSSEC responses are authenticted but not encrypted. DNSSEC does not protect agains DOS attacks directly. though it indirectly provides some benefit (because signature checking allows the use of potentially untrustworthy parties).

	DNSSEC works by digitally signing records for DNS lookup using public-key cryptography. The correct DNSKEY record is authenticated wia a chain of trust, stating with a set of verified public keys for the DNS root zone which is the trusted third party.	
	

dnssec-keygen
	DNSSEC key generation tool

	dnssec-keygen generates keys for DNSSEC (secure dns), as defined in RFC 2535 and RFC 4034. ti can also generate keys for use with TSIG (transaction signatures) as defined in RFC 2845, or TKEY (transaction key) as defined in RFC 2930.

	the name of the key is specified on the command line. for DNSSEC keys, this must match the name of the zone for which the key is being generated.
i	dnssec-keygen -a DSA -b 768 -n ZONE example.com
	
	the command would print a string of the form:
	
	Kexample.com.+003+26160.key
	Kexample.com.+003+26160.private.
